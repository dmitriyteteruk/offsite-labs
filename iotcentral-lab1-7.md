In Dashboad menu choose `Multi Sensor Device v1` in *Device template* drop-down menu, then choose `Multi Sensor Device v1 - xxxxx` in *Device instance* drop-down menu. You will see list of all possible telemetry options that we are collecting.

Drag and Drop to dashboard following telemetry tiles:
 - Count1 (this is people counter sensor installed near cahs-desk #1)
 - Count2 (this is people counter sensor installed near cahs-desk #2)
 - Count3 (this is people counter sensor installed near cahs-desk #3)
 - Dwell Time 1 (this is time counter sensor installed near cahs-desk #1)

You can drag and drop and modify tiles one by one or drag and drop all tiles and then modify them.
