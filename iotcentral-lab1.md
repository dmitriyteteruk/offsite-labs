# LAB 1 - Retail Scenario

### Background story
You are at industry event and a visitor start discussion during networking session.
> Hello! 
My name is James Bond and I am owner of a retail store. It is important for me to be sure that environment in my store is good (not very cold and not too hot) and clients feels good. At the same time I need to be sure that dwell time is adequate and customers do not spend half of day in a queues. In addition, it is very important to be aware if temperatures in Frozen or Cold zones is out of normal range to avoid unnecessary lost from spoiled goods.
